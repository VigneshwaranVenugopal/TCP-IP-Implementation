# TCP-IP-Implementation
You are given an array of 8 bit integers. The array of bytes represents an IPv4 (L3) packet followed by (L4) packet which could be a UDP packet, a TCP packet  or neither of those in which case it is IP Other (IPO).  The array can be any length.  We wish to build a simple protocol stack to “unpack” this array of raw data into properties in appropriate protocol layer classes.    To do this, we would like to define a “packet class” as a container of any additional classes for the L3 and L4 or additional classes to represent the unpacked L3 and L4 and provide the unpacking service/methods.   We would like to also handle any erroneous or error cases that you feel might exist when unpacking.
